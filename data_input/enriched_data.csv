Men and Women,1964,https://boxd.it/au15ML,5.0,"A classe burguesa, que apesar de ter acesso a tudo, vive frustrada, entediada, desconectada. Eles têm “poder social”(dinheiro, status, prestígio) mas não têm potência emocional nenhuma. São ricos, mas impotentes diante da própria solidão. Mostrando que dinheiro não trás realização alguma.

Esses personagens estão tão inseridos numa lógica de troca (grana por afeto, sexo por presença) que já não conseguem mais se relacionar de verdade. Tudo é mercadoria, até o sentimento. As relações são frias, calculadas, sem alma.

As prostitutas sabem que o jogo é esse: vender companhia pra homens vazios. Mas mesmo com alguma liberdade dentro do sistema, também estão presas numa lógica onde tudo tem preço e nada tem valor.

Noite Vazia é sobre o colapso das relações humanas numa sociedade onde até o prazer é capitalizado. Um retrato da classe dominante em crise existencial, afogada em consumo, mas com o coração seco.

o tempo não é apresentado como neutro ou metafísico apenas, mas uma força real que atravessa o sujeito. o experimento temporal realizado sobre o protagonista revela a forma extrema da instrumentalização do corpo e da memória. o valor do individuo não está em sua vida concreta, livre arbítrio, ou liberdade como os neoliberais gostam de afirmar, mas em sua capacidade de sustentar uma imagem que possa ser explorado para garantir a sobrevivência futura de uma sociedade devastada, uma vez que o filme acontece no pós “Terceira Guerra Mundial”. essa imagem atravessa toda a sua vida porque a história não se apresenta como sucessão livre de momentos, mas como estrutura que se repete e se impõe. o tempo, assim, torna-se algo a ser explorado, acumulado e dominado por aqueles que detêm os meios técnicos e políticos. o protagonista não escolhe sua lembrança fundadora, ela é imposta. o filme expõe esse loop histórico da dominação. o futuro que prometia salvação repete a violência do presente, que já estava inscrita no passado e as relações de poder permanecem intactas. é passado porque carrega uma memória que o constitui, é presente porque seu corpo sofre a violência concreta do experimento e é futuro porque sua existência é constantemente justificada por aquilo que ainda não ocorreu. o sujeito é dominado pelo tempo. o tempo não é emancipador apenas reorganiza a mesma estrutura de exploração.",2025-12-09,7.875,A man confronts his past during an experiment that attempts to find a solution to the problems of a post-apocalyptic world caused by a world war.,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction']",['Chris Marker'],['France'],29
